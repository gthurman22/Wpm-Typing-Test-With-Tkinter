```py
import tkinter as tk
import random
import time
#Tkinter is ran as 'Tk' module, and will most likely be pre-installed on newer versions of Python
#Other than your IDE, python, and a little creativity to define sentences nothing else is required for this project
#Change the font type, size, or how many sentences you would like to your preference
